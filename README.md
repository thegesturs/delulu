# Delulu

Open-source social scheduling infrastructure for AI agents.

Delulu gives people and agents one permission-aware system for preparing media,
drafting, scheduling, publishing, reviewing, and inspecting social content across
Instagram, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest, Threads, YouTube, Bluesky,
and Farcaster.

## Why Delulu

- **Agent-native interfaces:** hosted MCP, a deterministic CLI with a packaged
  agent skill, and a typed REST API.
- **Human control:** delegated OAuth scopes, live workspace roles, optional post
  reviews, and revocable credentials.
- **Reliable publishing:** explicit draft/schedule/publish intent, durable
  operation identity, target-level results, retries, and partial-failure states.
- **Complete workflow:** media preparation, multi-network publishing, analytics,
  collaboration, and programmable automations.
- **Open source:** AGPL-3.0 licensed, with a supported Docker Compose deployment.

## Give an agent access

For a local agent, install the CLI and its packaged skill:

```bash
npm install --global delulu-cli
delulu integrate install
delulu login
```

For a browser-capable MCP client, connect:

```text
https://solulu.delulu.social/mcp
```

The human completes sign-in and approves a workspace plus scopes. The agent
never needs a social password or a pasted bearer token.

See the [agent setup guide](https://docs.delulu.social/getting-started/agent-setup/)
for the complete flow.

## Self-host

The Community deployment unlocks core scheduling, publishing, agent interfaces,
workspaces, reviews, and automations. You pay only for your infrastructure and
external providers.

```bash
cp deploy/self-host/.env.example deploy/self-host/.env
# Fill the required Clerk, R2, agent-signing, encryption, URL, and provider values.
docker compose --env-file deploy/self-host/.env \
  -f deploy/self-host/compose.yaml up -d --build --wait
```

The first self-hosted release requires operator-owned Clerk and Cloudflare R2
projects. Generic OIDC and S3-compatible storage are planned portability work;
the application services keep those dependencies behind replaceable boundaries.

Read the [self-hosting guide](https://docs.delulu.social/self-hosting/) before
exposing an instance to the internet. It covers required credentials,
callbacks, migrations, health checks, backups, upgrades, and limitations.

## Architecture

```text
human consent ─┐
               ├─ authenticated app ─┐
agent ─ MCP ───┤                     │
agent ─ CLI ───┼─ typed API ─ PostgreSQL ─ publisher ─ social networks
code  ─ REST ──┘          │
                          └─ object storage
```

The Docker deployment runs PostgreSQL, a migration job, the authenticated app,
the API, and a PostgreSQL-backed publisher. The hosted deployment can keep its
edge runtime and queue transport without changing domain behavior.

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.12 or newer
- pnpm 10.8.0 through Corepack
- Docker

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm pg:up
pnpm pg:migrate
cp apps/api/.dev.vars.example apps/api/.dev.vars
pnpm dev:app+api
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:3000` and the API worker runs on
`http://127.0.0.1:8788`. Point a Cloudflare Tunnel API route at port `8788`,
then register these public webhook endpoints:

```text
https://<api-tunnel-host>/webhooks/clerk
https://<api-tunnel-host>/webhooks/dodo
https://<api-tunnel-host>/webhooks/meta
https://<api-tunnel-host>/webhooks/cal
```

Copy each provider's signing secret into the matching variable documented in
`apps/api/.dev.vars.example`. OAuth connection callbacks also use the API
tunnel host under `/v1/connections/callback/:provider`.

Focused surfaces:

```bash
pnpm dev:web
pnpm dev:docs
pnpm cli -- --help
pnpm mcp
```

### Icon tiers

Application code imports icons through the neutral `@delulu/icons` package
alias. Public checkouts, Community builds, and self-hosted images resolve that
alias to the redistributable free icon set.

Licensed maintainers can use the Pro solid-rounded set in a private hosted
build without changing application imports:

```bash
pnpm icons:pro
# Configure the licensed @hugeicons-pro registry in the private build environment.
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
```

The Pro command changes workspace manifests for that build. Do not commit the
resulting Pro dependency or lockfile, and never commit the registry token. Run
`pnpm icons:free && pnpm install` to return to the public Community setup. Only
developers covered by the appropriate icon license should access or maintain
the Pro build.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm pg:migration-lint
```

Database integration suites require a migrated PostgreSQL instance. Container
and self-host smoke checks run in CI.
